# Call Centre Data Analysis Project using Power BI
Welcome to the Call Centre Data Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing call centre data using Power BI. The dataset used in this project contains data from October 2020.

**Overview**:
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into call centre performance and customer interactions. By leveraging Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities, we aim to uncover trends, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

**Contents**:
1. **Data Source**: The dataset for October 2020 contains information on call details, including call duration, customer demographics, reason for calling, resolution status, etc.
